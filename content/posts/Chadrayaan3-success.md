<Notice type="Summary">
  India's Chandrayaan-3 lander successfully landed on the moon's South Pole on August 23. The Pragyaan rover encountered a crater but navigated safely. Two objectives were met: a gentle moon landing and rover mobility display. Ongoing experiments are progressing well, including a thermal study. The Chandrayaan-3 rover explored the lunar surface, covering 8 meters. This achievement makes India the fourth country to successfully land on the moon after the US, China, and Russia.

On August 23, India achieved a remarkable milestone as the Chandrayaan-3 lander module made a successful landing on the moon's South Pole. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) announced that the Pragyaan rover of Chandrayaan-3 encountered a 4-meter diameter crater positioned 3 meters ahead of its intended location on the lunar surface.    

ISRO confirmed that the rover is now safely navigating on its new path. Previously, on Sunday, ISRO reported that two out of the three objectives of the Chandrayaan-3 mission had been achieved: demonstrating a safe and gentle landing on the moon's surface and showcasing the rover's mobility on the lunar terrain.

The space agency also disclosed that ongoing in-situ scientific experiments are being conducted, and all payloads are functioning as expected.

In a significant scientific breakthrough, Chandrayaan-3 conducted a comprehensive study of the soil at the moon's south pole, including temperature variations up to a depth of 10cm beneath the surface. ISRO shared a temperature profile graph of the moon's soil at different depths. The "ChaSTE" (Chandra's Surface Thermophysical Experiment) project involved temperature measurements of the lunar topsoil to comprehend the thermal properties of the moon's surface. The experiment utilized a temperature probe with controlled penetration capabilities that can reach depths of 10 cm below the surface, equipped with ten temperature sensors.

ISRO previously showcased visuals of the Pragyaan rover exploring the 'Shiv Shakti' Point, the designated landing site of Chandrayaan-3. The rover covered a distance of 8 meters during its journey on the lunar surface.

India's accomplishment on August 23 marked a significant advancement, with the Chandrayaan-3 lander successfully touching down on the moon's South Pole. This achievement follows the setback of the Chandrayaan-2 crash landing four years earlier. As a result, India has become the fourth nation, after the US, China, and Russia, to achieve a successful landing on the lunar surface.
