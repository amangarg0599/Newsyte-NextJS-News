So, you know there's been a lot of buzz about the upcoming Pixel 8 series, right? Some folks were saying it might totally ditch the physical SIM card slot and go all-in on eSIM like the iPhone 14 does in the US. But guess what? Our pals over at 9to5Google got the inside scoop, and they're saying, "Hold on a sec, that's not happening!"

So, here's the deal: the Pixel 8 series is gonna stick with that trusty physical SIM card tray. No eSIM-only shenanigans here. But that's not all â€“ the Pixel 8 Pro is stepping up its camera game with Night Sight for video. Low-light recording is gonna get a serious boost, and that could be the big highlight of the new camera setup.

Remember how the Pixel 6 made Night Sight photos super sharp and detailed? They did it by beefing up the rear sensor, adding laser autofocus, and using some Tensor magic. Then, the Pixel 7 cut down motion blur by tinkering with HDR+ and throwing in some machine learning tricks.



Now, the Pixel 8 Pro is taking things up a notch with Night Sight for video. That's right, you'll be able to capture awesome low-light videos. And all this is thanks to Google's Tensor chip, which has been turbocharging features like Live HDR+ and real-time tone mapping.

Now, back to that eSIM talk. Yeah, it's true that eSIM is becoming more popular, thanks to iPhones and such. Android's been catching up slowly but surely. However, there are still some tricky situations, like when you're globetrotting and local carriers don't play nice with eSIM.

But worry not! According to those in the know, the SIM card tray is here to stay in the Pixel 8 series, just like you'd expect. It's gonna be on the left edge, business as usual. So, you'll have the best of both worlds â€“ the trusty SIM card and all the cool new tech in the Pixel 8. Cheers to that! ðŸ“±ðŸŒŸ
