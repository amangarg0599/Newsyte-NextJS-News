In a familiar turn of events, Google has once again fallen victim to leaks surrounding its flagship Pixel devices. The yet-to-be-officially-announced Pixel 8 Pro has made an appearance on a Google Store webpage. Twitter user @Android_Setting / X was quick to point out the image, which was featured on a page highlighting various Google subscriptions and services (not including Pixel Pass). The image depicts an individual engaged in a phone call using a Pixel 8 Pro in the "Porcelain" color variant.

While the visual representation of the device closely aligns with previously leaked renders and images, some skepticism remains regarding its authenticity. However, a positive development for accessibility lies in the image's alt-text description, which explicitly states, "A person takes a call on a Pixel 8 Pro phone in Porcelain."

**Let's take a closer look**.

The portrayed individual, donning glasses and a knit cap, converses on a cellular phone identified by Google as the Pixel 8 Pro in the Porcelain color option.

The leaked design corresponds with earlier leaks, showcasing a glass oval housing the rear cameras that protrude within a bar design reminiscent of recent Pixel phone models. The leaked image, though devoid of internal specifications, supplements the wealth of information we have already gathered about the device, encompassing details about specifications, screen quality, RAM capacity, camera hardware, and potential software enhancements like Video Unblur.

Reflecting on Google's history of inadvertently exposing its hardware ahead of official announcements, my colleague Sean Hollister previously delved into the matter when reporting on a Pixel 7A leak preceding this year's I/O event:

"Indeed, we branded the Pixel 4 as one of the most-leaked phones to date â€” a designation earned even after numerous Russian-speaking bloggers obtained the Pixel 3 XL. The Nexus 4 underwent comprehensive reviews prior to its official unveiling. The Pixel 4A and Pixel 5 experienced leaks at an alarming rate, while Google itself provided a sneak peek of the 6A through a coloring book, reminiscent of the accidental reveal of the Nexus 5 in a YouTube video. The Pixel 6 was subjected to unboxing leaks, and the Pixel 6 Pro even faced a teardown before its official launch. The pattern is clear: Google now leans towards early teases of its upcoming gadgets."

> All that remains is capturing a moment of Giannis Antetokounmpo utilizing the device, and the stage will be set for the highly anticipated Pixel 8 launch event.
