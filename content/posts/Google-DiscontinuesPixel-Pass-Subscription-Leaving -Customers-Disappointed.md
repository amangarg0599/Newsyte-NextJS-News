Google has abruptly ended its Pixel Pass subscription program, which offered customers a package deal including a Pixel phone, mobile services, device protection, and regular device upgrades for a monthly fee. This move has left Pixel owners disappointed, as they expected a no-brainer upgrade process after two years.

In October 2021, Google introduced Pixel Pass alongside the Pixel 6 series, promising users a comprehensive package. However, on August 29, 2023, Google informed Pixel Pass customers via email that they would no longer offer new subscriptions or renewals for the service.

While existing customers won't lose privileges they've paid for, such as phone costs and bundled services over the two-year term, they are disappointed about losing access to grandfathered rates and bundled services they enjoyed as part of the package.

The most significant letdown is the discontinuation of the promised "regular device upgrades." Even those who rushed to order a Pixel 6 when it first launched will not be eligible for an upgrade as part of the Pixel Pass.

Google's decision to cancel Pixel Pass is not entirely surprising given its history of discontinuing products and services. Still, the timing, just as the Pixel 8 lineup launch approaches on October 4th, is noteworthy.

Google's FAQ suggests that customers can still upgrade their Pixel device after 24 months with 0 percent APR financing through Google Fi or the Google Store, working with the same partner as Pixel Pass, Synchrony Bank. However, they cannot maintain the Pixel Pass package after it expires.

Refunds are not being issued, but Google is offering a $100 loyalty reward credit to all active subscribers. This credit can be used for future purchases, either in the Google Store or towards a Pixel device purchase on Google Fi Wireless. While this credit softens the blow, it still leaves a sting, as it requires customers to continue their engagement with Google.

In summary, Google's decision to discontinue Pixel Pass has left loyal Pixel customers without the promised regular device upgrades, disappointing many who had hoped for a seamless upgrade experience.
