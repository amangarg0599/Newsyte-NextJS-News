In September 2022, Apple released the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro models, but anticipation for the iPhone 15 has been building since before the latest models' release. As the launch of the iPhone 15 nears, more rumors have surfaced, revealing several key features and changes to expect.

Apple's plan is to introduce four iPhone 15 models, maintaining the same sizes as the iPhone 14 lineup. These models will include two 6.1-inch iPhones and two 6.7-inch iPhones. One of the 6.1-inch variants will be the standard iPhone 15, while the 6.7-inch category will feature an iPhone 15 "Plus." The remaining 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch models will be higher-end "Pro" versions, likely with higher prices.

Like the iPhone 14/14 Pro distinction, the iPhone 15 Pro models will offer superior features to justify their higher cost. Some prominent expectations include the transition to a USB-C port across all iPhone 15 models, and the introduction of the Dynamic Island feature, which will replace the notch design on the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, similar to what was seen in the iPhone 14 Pro models.

Regarding hardware, Apple will likely use Qualcomm modem chips for the iPhone 15 lineup due to delays in its own modem chip development. The standard iPhone 15 models will upgrade to the A16 chip, whereas the iPhone 15 Pro models will feature the more advanced 3-nanometer A17 chips for better performance and efficiency. Notably, the Pro models might also receive design enhancements like titanium frames, slimmer bezels, and curved edges, along with periscope lens technology for improved zoom capabilities on the Pro Max variant.

Rumors suggest that the pricing structure for the iPhone 15 models will remain consistent with previous models, with the standard 6.1-inch variant starting at $799 and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus starting at $899.

While these details encompass a comprehensive overview of the iPhone 15, more specific information about the higher-end iPhone 15 Pro models can be found in a separate report.

To sum up, the iPhone 15 launch is imminent, with expectations for four models in the same sizes as the iPhone 14 lineup. Notable changes include USB-C ports, the adoption of Dynamic Island, and various hardware upgrades, while maintaining a similar pricing structure.
